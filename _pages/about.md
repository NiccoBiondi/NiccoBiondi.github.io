### **Hi, I'm Niccolò\!** 👋

I'm a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)](http://www.micc.unifi.it/) at the University of Florence.

My work is all about building smarter and more adaptable AI. I explore advanced machine learning and computer vision systems, with a keen interest in **multimodal learning** and **biomedical applications**. At the core of my research is **representation learning**—I design **backward-compatible and stationary representations** that allow large-scale AI models to be updated seamlessly and efficiently, without having to start from scratch.

My research has been published in top-tier venues like **NeurIPS**, **CVPR (highlight)**, and **IEEE TPAMI**.

I'm truly passionate about these topics and I'm always excited to discuss new ideas, potential collaborations, or just chat about the future of machine learning. Please feel free to get in touch\!
